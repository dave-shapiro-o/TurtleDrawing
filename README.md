# TurtleDrawing
Another extension of a course exercise.

This console app animates the drawing of simple patterns from text instructions. 
It can either read the instructions from a text file stored in the project's debug or release folder, 
or they can be entered manually.
It saves and loads a list of preset patterns by serialising to an XML file.
The turtle starts in the centre of a 25 x 25 grid.
